aser-Dirks DG-101G, January, 2015

This is free add-on for aeroflyFS developed by Krzysztof Kaniewski, 
3D model (for FlightGear) by Nikolaus Kerner http://www.flightgear.org/download/aircraft-v3-2/.

Tested only on aeroflyFS for WIndows ver 1.2.0.5, but should work on aeroflyFS for Mac ver 1.3.1 .
Some features may not work as intended and this aircraft could crash your aeroflyFS. Use it at your own risk!

------------------------------------------------------------
Installation:

1. Unzip file and move the folder "dg-101g" to C:\Users\~\Documents\aerofly FS\aircraft .

2. Browse to your aeroflyFS installation path, open the folder of the Swift S1 ("aircraft\swifts1"), and copy all *.tsb files into "dg-101g" folder.

------------------------------------------------------------
Some useful features:

There are 2 extra liveries: d-0815 & d-4711
To set livery (may not work on Macintosh!), choose 'DG-101G' glider, exit aeroflyFS and edit 'main.mcf' the line 
from: <[string8][model_0_paint][]>
to:	<[string8][model_0_paint][liveries/d-0815]>
or to:	<[string8][model_0_paint][liveries/d-4711]>
Choosing another plane reset to default livery.
